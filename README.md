# Medication Management System

## Project Overview

This project implements a medication management system using a linked list data structure in C++. It's designed to help pharmacies manage their medication stock efficiently, providing functionalities such as adding new medications, displaying the inventory, consulting medication details, and managing stock based on expiry dates and quantity thresholds.

- **Identify At-risk Medications**: Highlight medications with quantities below a certain threshold.
- **Update Stock**: Sell medications (decreasing stock) and restock medications (increasing stock).
